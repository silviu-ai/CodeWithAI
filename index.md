### Welcome to Code With AI! ###

In this repository, Iâ€™ll explore the world of AI-powered development tools that can significantly improve your coding workflow. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or just getting started, leveraging AI can help you code faster, smarter, and with more fun. I will share my experiences in building AI-powered tools and provide you with practical tips and tutorials on how to integrate these tools into your daily coding routine.

### What Youâ€™ll Find Here ###

- **Guides and Tutorials:** Step-by-step instructions on how to set up an AI development lab, integrate and use AI models like LLMs (Large Language Models) or SLMs (Small Language Models), AI coding helpers, and everything that you can use to make your life as a software engineer easier.
- **Best Practices:** Tips and tricks on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of AI tools in your daily coding tasks.
- **Real-World Examples:** Practical examples and case studies demonstrating how AI can solve common software engineering challenges.
- **Tool Comparisons:** In-depth comparisons of various AI tools to help you choose the right one for your needs.

### Why Code With AI? ###

AI tools are revolutionizing the way we develop software by automating repetitive tasks, suggesting intelligent code completions, and even generating code snippets from natural language descriptions. This repository aims to be your go-to resource for learning how to harness the power of these tools to boost your productivity and bring joy to your coding journey.

### Before I Begin ###

Before we dive into the world of AI-powered development tools, let me introduce myself. Iâ€™m Silviu, a software engineer, architect, lead, mentor, and AI enthusiast. I have been working on AI-powered development tools for the past few years and have seen firsthand how they can transform the way we code. Iâ€™m excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you and help you level up your coding game with AI.

I believe the AI revolution that began a few years ago has the potential to significantly boost productivity in software development. However, I believe AI is not meant to replace developers, whether they are just starting their careers or are more experienced. Instead, it is designed to empower them. While AI can be an incredibly helpful tool, it can also sometimes be imperfect and obstructive. My hope is that the knowledge shared here will help you navigate the world of AI tools and find the right balance that works best for you.

If this text looks like it was written by AI, itâ€™s because it was. ðŸ˜ƒ I used OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o to generate the initial content for this post, to generate the above image, to correct grammar mistakes, and to improve the reading flow. I will be using AI tools throughout this repository to demonstrate their capabilities and provide you with practical examples of how they can be used to help in your daily work. After all, these tools are here to help! **Letâ€™s Code With AI!** ðŸš€
