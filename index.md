### Why Code With AI?

AI tools are revolutionizing the way we develop software by automating repetitive tasks, suggesting intelligent code completions, and even generating code snippets from natural language descriptions. This repository aims to be your go-to resource for learning how to harness the power of these tools to boost your productivity and bring joy to your coding journey.

### Before I Begin ###

Before we dive into the world of AI-powered development tools, let me introduce myself. I'm [Silviu](https://silviu-ai.github.io/), a software engineer/architect/lead/mentor and AI enthusiast. I have been working on AI-powered development tools for the past few years and have seen firsthand how they can transform the way we code. I'm excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you and help you level up your coding game with AI.

I do believe that the AI revolution that started a few years ago can help significantly improve productivity in software development. However, I also believe that AI is not here to replace developers either at the beginning of their careers or more advanced, but to empower them. I do see AI as a imperfect tool that sometimes can help tremendously and sometimes can get in the way. I hope that this knowledge tthat I am sharing here will help you navigate the world of AI tools and find the right balance for you.

If this text looks like it was written by AI, it's because it was. :smiley: I used OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate the initial content for this post. I will be using AI tools throughout this repository to demonstrate their capabilities and provide you with practical examples of how they can be used to help in your daily work. After all, these tools are here to help!. Let's Code With AI!
